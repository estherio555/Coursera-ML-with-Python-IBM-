# Projects - Predicting Loan payment Status
In this project, I completed a notebook where I built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

I used the training set to build various model, then use the test set to report the accuracy of the model.
I used the following algorithm:

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index

F1-score

LogLoss

### About dataset

This dataset is about past loans. The __Loan_train.csv__ data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. It includes following fields:
